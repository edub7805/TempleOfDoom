# The Temple Of Doom

The Temple of Doom is a simple, text-based action-adventure game where the player navigates through a multi-level temple in search of a golden idol. Inspired by classic adventure themes, the game challenges players to battle monsters, collect treasures, and strategically maneuver through a maze-like temple.
